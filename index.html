        <h2>About Raul</h2>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item item-double">
            <p>
              After graduating from UW Parkside with a degree in Computer
              Science, I opened a trucking company as the sole owner. This was a
              new and challenging experience, however, it did not feel like the
              right fit for me. After all, the reason I had even chosen computer
              science as my major was the result of the joy I felt creating my
              first programs in Qbasic back in high school. The feeling of
              accomplishment I got after finally getting the computer to do what
              I wanted was great!
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are looking for a new addition to your developer team,
              please keep me in mind. Although my research internship was a
              collaboration between 3 people, I also have experience in an agile
              development setting using SCRUM from a university final project. I
              recall how exciting the group projects were and can not wait to
              repeat the experience of building great software together!
